### Thought this was a good description of myself so I'll put this here:

I'm mainly a C++ developer, 24 years (as of 2021), although I started off in plain C.  Before this I learned QBasic.  Along with this I've been using Linux since I downloaded Red Hat on a dial up connection, so almost for just as long.  I used to hack video game consoles but not too much more on the hardware side of things now - besides acquiring more of it haha.  I found it necessary to purchase a 60 core 240 thread x64 processor out of a decommissioned Chinese supercomputer (an Intel Xeon Phi)!  But I'm a true AMD fan :)  Proud to say all my personal boxes have been AMD since the first one I built (an AMD K6-2).  Outside of that I have a decent amount of experience with Python.  At this point I'm starting to study mathematics more along with programming as I'm very interested in physics.  I've done a lot of 2D graphics programming in the past and am currently working on getting my skills up to 3D.  Something I'm sad to say is long overdue as I developed a ray tracer back in 2001 (the tech used in the old game Doom).  I've been focusing on my personal work more now.  Hope you enjoy my work and thanks for browsing!
